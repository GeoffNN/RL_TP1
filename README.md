# RL_TP1

Files are organized according to the questions. 
 * q1.py contains the implementation of the TreeCut problem: simulating trajectories and implementation of the Markov Decision Problem.
 * q2.py contains the implementation of a Policy, and of estimations of the corresponding value function. Two methods are implemented: 
    * Monte Carlo estimator
    * Fixed point for the Bellman operator estimator
 * q3.py implements two algorithms for optimal policy finding:
    * Value Iteration
    * Policy Iteration
 * main.py contains scripts for running the other files.
