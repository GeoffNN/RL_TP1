# RL_TP1

This code's aim is to answer Alessandro Lazaric and Emilie Kaufmann's assignments for the Reinforcement course of the MVA. The instructions for the assignments can be found on Emilie Kaufmann's page: http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/teaching.html.

Files are organized according to the questions. 
 * q1.py contains the implementation of the TreeCut problem: simulating trajectories and implementation of the Markov Decision Problem.
 * q2.py contains the implementation of a Policy, and of estimations of the corresponding value function. Two methods are implemented: 
    * Monte Carlo estimator
    * Fixed point for the Bellman operator estimator
 * q3.py implements two algorithms for optimal policy finding:
    * Value Iteration
    * Policy Iteration
 * main.py contains scripts for running the other files.
 
 It uses Elie Michel's version of Emilie Kaufmann's code, transfered from MATLAB to Python.
